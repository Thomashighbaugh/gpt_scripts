# Environmental Bootstrapping Scripts

The scripts in this subdirectory bootstrap the shell environment using `python-venv` virtual environments for cases where that is desirable or necessary to utilize the imported python modules and libraries that the scripts in this repository rely on. While originally more of a note to myself, I have created versions of the original script for the shell environments I might use (bash and zsh) and have included them here for anyone else who might find them useful.

Those using alternative shells like fish or [inset one of numerous alternative shells for Unix-like systems] as well as those using Windows derived shells like PowerShell (yuck) are on their own but should feel free to make a pull request if interested in contributing ports to those shells as I would happily include them here.
